# Required technologies:
# Node, Express, Angular, postgres database
======================
# You'll also need to ensure that you have a user 'todo' on the postgres database with password 'letmein'.
# This user needs to have all the create/select table privileges inside of the database.
======================
# You'll have to start running these commands into the directory one level up from this current directory

cd node-postgres-todo 
npm install
npm install supervisor -g
npm install pg --save

psql -U postgres -c "CREATE USER todo WITH PASSWORD 'letmein' CREATEDB;"
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE todo;"
psql -U postgres -c "GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE todo TO todo;"
psql -U postgres -c "GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO todo;"

node models/database.js

# Start up the node 
npm start

# Then on your web browser localhost:3000

# NOTE: Once the node has been started a javascript global variable will be created which
# will store the most recent list of client account from the database. If the connection to 
# the database is lost when this service is up, then an error will be printed as an output
# as well as the stored list of account. This will also happen is something causes the table
# to become corrupt or is destroyed.
